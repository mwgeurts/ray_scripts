##### Requirements.txt for ray_scripts in Python 3 #####
#
### Notes ###
## 9/20/2020
# * Instantiation
# * I added two libraries to the list given to me by Craig Fitzwilliams
# ** Jupyter notebooks (notebook) for interactive development
# ** Matplotlib (matplotlib) for basic plotting functionality (nice for Jupyter)
# * When an environment is created in RayStation, numpy and pythonnet are installed
#   by default but the versions that are installed are outdated. I have added >= for
#   these libraries to ensure they are updated when the user installs using pip.
# * pynetdicom has been added, pynetdicom3 has been removed. The latter, which was
# * used with our Python 2 ray_scripts, is deprecated.
# * PySimpleGUI was installed with bindings for PySide2 (Qt for Python) and tkinter.
