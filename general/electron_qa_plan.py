""" Create Electron QA Plan

    Creates a QA plan for an electron beam onto a water phantom in order to compare RayStation vs. Mobius MU.
    
    This script will create a QA plan in the Plan preparation workspace, using a 50cm cube water 
    phantom. This phantom has POIs spaced every 1mm on the CAX.  The patient-specific cutout will 
    be used but the couch and and gantry angles will be set to zero. The default SSD is 105cm so 
    the user will need to manually edit the QA plan for a different SSD.  The dose grid resolution
    is 2.5mm and 500K histories will be used.

    Validation Notes: The script relies on the status of the QA phantom being verifiable as read-only.  
                      Due to a programming error in RayStation 6.0 this status validation fails when 
                      QA plans are generated as part of a python script.  Therefore, unless the user 
                      has, without a script, validated the read-only status of the plan by opening a 
                      "dummy" QA plan, the script will fail to execute. 
    
    Version Notes: 1.0.0 Original
                   1.0.1 Added a relabeling of the plan to include the Beamset name to avoid ambiguity 
                         when the "Mobius MU" plan name is taken.  Also changed the active phantom to 
                         50cmCube for the clinical institution.  Added autorecompute and deleted incorrect
                         plan recomputation syntax.
                   1.0.2 Added main function call, eliminated blanket connect import, autoclick QA prep
                   1.1.0 Update to Rs 10A
