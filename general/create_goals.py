""" Create Clinical Goals and Objectives

    Add clinical goals and objectives in RayStation given user supplied inputs
    At this time, we are looking in the UW protocols directory for a
    list of approved protocols

    We may want to extend this main function to a simple function which would potentially
    take the path as an argument.

    Script will ask user for a protocol and potentially an order.  It will then find the
    doses that are to be used. If protocol defined doses exist and matches are found to
    target names it will load those first.

    Inputs::
        None at this time

    Dependencies::
        Note that protocols are assumed to have even priorities describing targets
    
    Validation Notes:
    Test Patient: MR# ZZUWQA_ScTest_05Jan2020,
