""" Create External DIBH and FB Contours

This script accomplishes the following tasks:
1. Renames CT datasets to "DIBH" and "Free-breathing".
2. Renames "External" to "External_DIBH" on the DIBH planning scan.
3. Creates an external contour on the free-breathing scan called "External_FB"
4. Copies "External_FB" to the DIBH planning scan.

This script was tested with:
* Patient: Example, OSMS
* MRN: 20170327DJJ
* RayStation: Launcher 8B SP2 - Test (Development Server)
