""" Export Tomo DQA Plan to QA Destination

    The delta4 software needs the gantry period to load the plan, however
    it doesn't live as a native object in RS. The user is prompted to enter it
    then the data is exported to a temporary directory and this information is
    input.
    This script:
    -Checks for a beamset to be loaded
    -Finds all QA plans which have the OfRadiationSet-DicomPlanLabel matching
     the current beamset.
    -Prompts the user to choose the desired plan for export, gantry period and
     dicom destination
    -Exports using the ValidationPlan.ScriptableQADicomExport method.
    TODO: When export to the RayGateWay is supported using the above method,
          enable multiple destinations to be selected.

    Version:
    1.0 Modify RS RTPlans to include a gantry period, needed by the Delta4 software,
        then send them to the specified destination with scp.

    1.0.1 Modify to allow for multiple qa plans. Prompt user for gantry period and directly
          send data. User is now asked to match the treatment plan they wish to send and no longer
          need delete multiple plans.

    1.0.2 Always bypass the diff checking on the tomo DQA plans. For long treatment fields
          this was taking a really long time and causing the association to time out.
